overview of recent employment shifts at EU aggregate
Box 1: Methodological note on the jobs-based approach
The main, simplified steps of the jobs-based approach are as follows:
1. Using the standard international classifications of occupation (ISCO-08) and sector (NACE Rev 2.0) at two-
digit level, a matrix of jobs is created in each country. Each job is an occupation in a sector. In total, there are
43 two-digit occupations and 88 two-digit sectors, which generate 3,784 job cells. In practice, many of the
theoretical job cells do not contain employment; there are unlikely to be many skilled agricultural workers in
financial services, for example. The country total of job cells with employment varies between around 400
and just over 2,000 and is largely determined by country size and labour force survey sample size. The bigger
the workforce, the greater the variety of possible job combinations that can be identified using LFS data.
2. The jobs in each country are ranked based on some ranking criterion, mainly the mean hourly wage. The job-
wage rankings for each country used in this report are based on combining data from the EU-LFS annual data
files for 2011–2014 and aggregated data from the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) for 2010. These sources
allowed the creation of country job-wage rankings for the 28 Member States.
3. Jobs were allocated to quintiles in each country based on the job-wage ranking for that country. The best-
paid jobs are assigned to quintile 5, the lowest-paid to quintile 1. Each quintile in each country should
represent as close as possible to 20% of employment in the starting period – in other words, jobs are
assigned to quintiles based on their employment weights. From this point on, the job-to-quintile assignments
remain fixed for each country so that, in all of the charts that follow in Part 1 of this report, a given quintile in
a given country (however broken down) always refers to employment data in a specific group of jobs
exclusive to that quintile. For presentation purposes, the focus then is shifted to the change in the stock of
employment at quintile level during a given period in each country (for example, 2011 Q2–2016 Q2).
Figure 3 illustrates in simplified format the three steps outlined above, using some of the top-paid and lowest-
paid jobs that employ large numbers at EU level as examples. (While the jobs are correctly assigned in terms of EU
quintile, the individual job-wage ranks, 1–4 and 1,105–1,108, are for illustrative purposes only.)

9Occupational change and wage inequality: European Jobs Monitor 2017
4. Net employment change between starting and concluding periods (in people employed) for each quintile in
each country is summed to establish whether net job growth has been concentrated in the top, middle or
bottom of the employment structure. This generates a series of charts similar to Figure 4. Except where
otherwise indicated, all charts in the report describe net employment change by quintile for the indicated
country or for the EU as a whole. The EU aggregate charts are based on applying a common EU job-wage
ranking (based on the weighted average of the standardised national job-wage rankings).
The resulting quintile charts give a simple, graphical representation of the extent of employment change in a
given period, as well as an indication of how that change has been distributed across jobs with different pay.
(A similar classification of jobs can be carried out using job-holders’ skills or a broad-based, multidimensional
indicator of job quality as a ranking criterion – see Annex 3.) Figure 4, for example, illustrates employment change
for the EU28 during 2011 Q2–2016 Q2 using the job-wage quintiles. The figure should be read from the leftmost
bar cluster (quintile 1, representing the lowest-paid jobs) to the rightmost cluster (quintile 5, representing the
highest-paid jobs). Net employment change is represented on the vertical axis, generally in thousands but

This method also offers further possibilities of breaking down these net employment changes by such categories
as gender, employment or professional status, or working time category (full time or part time), which are used
later in Part 1. For a more extensive description of the data processing involved, see Annex 3. Further background
documentation includes Eurofound (2008b), as well as extensive material in the annexes of previous European
Jobs Monitor (EJM) annual reports – see Eurofound (2008a, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015b) – where the same jobs-based
approach was used.
For the jobs-based approach to characterise employment shifts accurately, an important condition is that the
ordinal ranking of a job – whether that ranking is based on hourly wage, educational level of the job-holder or
some broader index of job quality – remains stable over the period covered. In practice, there is a high level of
correlation of job-based rankings over time – health professionals in the health sector tend to be in the top
quintile and cleaners and helpers in the services to buildings sector tend to be in the bottom quintile in most
periods – and across countries.

down into public and private service components. Public KIS comprises the following NACE sector categories: public administration; social security and
defence; education; and human health activities. Private KIS comprises all remaining knowledge-intensive services (see Annex 4 for a full list). It should be

8 This analysis relies on the LFS’s main variables capturing employment status. These differentiate between full-time and part-time work (ftpt), self-
employment and dependent employee status (stapro), and between those dependent employees with a permanent contract and those with a temporary
one. However, a weakness can be noted in any analysis of ‘atypicality’ or employment destandardisation that relies on these distinctions. It is increasingly
obvious that some emerging forms of employment relationship (for example, online platform workers, on-call workers or those working zero-hours
contracts in the UK) are not directly identifiable using the available LFS variables. Many online platform workers are likely to be part time, but it is only
now in some cases that labour law is being called on to arbitrate whether, for example, a taxi driver operating on a particular taxi-service platform is self-
employed or an employee of the platform provider. Even where such distinctions may have acquired legal clarity, an additional complication with the LFS
data – as with all surveys – is that it is based on individual survey responses, and respondents in similar situations may report differently on their own
status.

Summary
£ During 2013–2016, employment levels in the EU have exhibited their first sustained increase since the global
financial crisis. There were eight million more people at work in 2016 Q2 compared with three years
previously, and newer jobs are increasingly likely to be full time rather than part time.
£ The resumption of employment growth since 2013 has been manifested in particular in increasing shares of
new employment in low-paid and mid-paid jobs.
£ Over a longer time frame (going back to the late 1990s), higher-paid jobs have continued to show the fastest
employment growth relative to those in the rest of the wage distribution in both recessionary and non-
recessionary periods.
£ There continues to be a variety of patterns of employment shift across Member States. During 2011 Q2–2016
Q2, some countries exhibited one of the two main patterns of employment shift identified in the literature –
upgrading or polarisation; for example, Sweden was clearly upgrading while Belgium was clearly polarising.
Other countries, such as Hungary, Ireland and Italy, exhibited downgrading shifts, where relative
employment growth was strongest in low-paid jobs. As employment has recovered since 2013 in countries
such as Greece and Spain, where it had previously fallen sharply, much of the fresh growth has been in mid-
paying jobs – where most jobs were destroyed during the recession.
£ More than 7 out of 10 jobs in the EU are now in services (71%); the service sector alone has added over 8
million jobs in the EU since 2011. Recent service sector employment growth has been asymmetrically
polarised, with greater gains in the bottom and top quintiles relative to the middle. The predominantly state-
funded sectors of education and health have made an increasing contribution to top-quintile employment
growth, consistent with less-constrained public finances.
£ There has been an increase of manufacturing employment headcount by 1.5 million since 2013. Most of this
increase has been in top-quintile engineering, professional and management jobs and not in more
traditional, blue collar production roles. EU13 countries have been the main beneficiaries of net new
manufacturing employment.
£ The large-employing job with the fastest rate of growth (7%) is that of ICT professionals in computer
programming, a job occupied by relatively young and high-skilled workers. It is predominantly male but with
an increasing female share of employment (15%).
29Occupational change and wage inequality: European Jobs Monitor 2017
£ In the majority of other faster-growing large jobs, the share of older workers has increased significantly (by
over two percentage points since 2011), suggesting that extended working lives and later retirement are an
important factor in explaining recent employment growth.
£ As the recovery has strengthened, the standard or ‘core’ employment relationship – full-time, dependent
employment with a permanent contract – has accounted for much of the recent growth across the wage
distribution but with a skew towards well-paid jobs. At the same time, there is some evidence that atypical
employment forms such as part-time work and self-employment are becoming more prevalent even in
higher-skilled, higher-paying jobs.

14 This is a very simplified version of the argument of routine-biased technological change, for two reasons. First, the argument refers to change in wage
levels rather than the wage differentials observed at any point in time. Second, it does not replace but complements the human capital argument: the
level of routine would constitute a secondary axis of wage inequality, additional to the traditional axis of skills (thus, highly routine occupations would
tend to be in the middle of the wage distribution, rather than the bottom). A detailed discussion of this argument is beyond the scope of this report (see
Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 and Mishel et al, 2013), but the simple analysis presented in this report is still useful because, after decades of computerisation,
the predicted decline in wages of routine occupations should already be reflected in actually lower wages. In addition, recent empirical evidence suggests
that routine tasks and skill level are very strongly correlated, forming a common axis in terms of occupational differences rather than two different ones

48Static analysis of the role of occupations in determining the wage distribution
Summary
This first empirical section can be summarised with the following points.
£ Detailed occupations or jobs account for a significant part of wage inequality in Europe: between 40% and
50% in the countries studied here.
£ Human capital differences are part of the reason why occupations account for such a significant amount of
wage inequality, but not all. Occupations matter for wage inequality even if human capital differences are
controlled for.
£ Broad occupational classes defined by the nature of their employment contract and skill level can account
for a significant part of the explanatory power of occupations on wage inequality, though not all of it.
£ Occupational segregation by gender and age is also part of the reason why occupations structure a
significant amount of wage inequality, but only in some European countries.
Overall, occupations seem to play an important role on their own that cannot be (entirely) reduced to other
factors such as human capital, classes or segregation. Although the data used did not enable the direct evaluation
of the role of occupational closure mechanisms, they remain a plausible explanation for some of the observed
variance in wages that is linked to occupations but cannot be explained away by other factors.

inequalities (Thelen, 2012). But dualisation involves an increasing divide between the conditions of work and employment of insiders and outsiders, not a

as an inegalitarian version of the CME model. The effect of dualisation on the structuring role of occupations in wage inequality will depend on whether
the boundaries between insiders and outsiders cut across occupations or are associated with different occupational categories.

16 The countries shown are the same as those analysed in Chapter 5 using SES data, except that Finland has replaced Sweden. The reason is that the
Swedish results using EU-SILC seem problematic for occupations, with a much lower share of variance explained for no obvious reason. Since SES data
are much more adequate for the purposes of this study, it was decided to replace Sweden in this chapter with Finland as another representative of the
northern European social democratic economies.
17 The breaks in the NACE and ISCO classifications in Figures 19 and 20 are in some cases associated with discontinuities in the trend that should therefore
be ignored in the analysis. The clearest case is Spain, with big jumps around the classification breaks.

In 2016, somewhat later than in other developed
economies, the EU recovered all the net
employment losses sustained since the global
financial crisis. Employment growth since 2013 has
been only modestly skewed towards well-paid
jobs; growth has been robust in low-paid and
mid-paid jobs too. Newer jobs are increasingly
likely to be full time rather than part time. Part 1 of
this sixth annual European Jobs Monitor report

Q2. Part 2 examines the role that occupations play
in structuring European wage inequality. It finds
that occupations have their own effect on wage
inequality as well as mediating other factors such
as human capital and social class. It also finds that
occupational dynamics did not drive wage
inequality developments in the last decade, a
period of intense structural change in European
labour markets.
